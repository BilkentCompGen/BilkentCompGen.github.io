        <br />
        This project aims to develop innovative algorithms and software tools operating on portable computing platforms for rapid pathogen identification 
        and antibiotic resistance profiling in sepsis cases. Algorithms developed within the project will be specifically optimized to run efficiently on 
        low-cost mobile GPU platforms, such as Jetson Nano, as well as laptops, facilitating point-of-care pathogen detection especially in post-disaster 
        scenarios and rural locations. It is anticipated that the technologies developed through this project will substantially enhance early diagnosis 
        and rapid intervention capabilities in cases of sepsis and pathogen-induced outbreaks, providing significant economic and societal benefits to 
        healthcare systems.<br />
