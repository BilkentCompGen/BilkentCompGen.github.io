I'm an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Engineering](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/). My research interests include computational prediction of human genomic structural variation, and characterization of segmental duplications and copy-number polymorphisms using high throughput sequencing data, and acceleration of genome analysis through hardware/software co-development. See my [personal academic page](http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~calkan/) for teaching and other details.

I also serve as an Associate Editor for the [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics) journal, a Steering Committee Member for the [RECOMB-Seq Conference](https://recomb-seq.github.io/), an Organization Committee Member for the [HiTSeq Conference](http://hitseq.org/), an Editorial Board Member for the [Genome Research](https://genome.cshlp.org/) journal, and the Organization Committee Co-Chair of the [RECOMB 2023 Conference](https://recomb.org/recomb2023/) held in Ä°stanbul.
