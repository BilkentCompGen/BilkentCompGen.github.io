I am interested in algorithms & data structures and I have been doing competitive programming for years, or I used to do... I advanced to ICPC World Finals in 2021 which was held in Moscow. In 2022 summer, I was a part of Alkanlab London gang (there are a lot of people from Alkanlab there as I have heard of) where I did an internship at Meta. Other than serious stuff, I love chocolates, sleep, basketball and music (you may find me a bit "keko" but I am a big fan of arabesque music :D)
