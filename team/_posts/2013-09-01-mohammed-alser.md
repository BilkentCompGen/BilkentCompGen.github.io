I am leading the bioinformatics research group at the [SAFARI research group](https://safari.ethz.ch), at ETH Zurich, since September 2018.

My primary research incorporates several aspects of bioinformatics, computer science, and computer engineering as I develop new data structures, algorithms, and software tools, and architect/co-design hardware with software for better understanding genetic disorders, improving our health with personalized medicine, and identifying pathogens and microbiomes around us. Such a multifaceted approach is necessary, as overcoming bottlenecks throughout different genomic methods and applications requires rethinking the complete compute stack, starting from the way we handle input data and algorithms, to the underlying hardware architecture.

### Education

  - [Bilkent University](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey
  - Advisors: Can Alkan & Onur Mutlu.
  - Thesis: Accelerating the understanding of lifeâ€™s code through better algorithms and hardware design.
  - Received the Doctoral Dissertation Award by IEEE Turkey.
  - Funding: NIH grant (R01 HG006004), Bilkent Merit Scholarship, HiPEAC Collaboration Grant, and TUBITAK 2215 fellowship.
  - Cumulative GPA: A out of A, 8 graduate-level courses. Passed 3-day written qualifying doctoral exam.

- Computational Genomics Summer Institute (CGSI), [Summers of 2016 and 2017]
  - University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)	Los Angeles, United States
  - An NIH-funded research residency and training program in methodology development for genomics.
